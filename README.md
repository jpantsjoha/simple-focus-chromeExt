# Simple Focus Mode

This is my take on the **Simple Focus Mode**  Extension which I have created for Chrome.

> I just published Simple Focus Mode: Boost Your Productivity with My Chrome Extension https://link.medium.com/iGcsnNTTezb 

This is a simple Pomodoro Timer extension for Google Chrome called **Simple Focus Mode**. It helps users improve productivity by breaking their work into focused intervals, separated by short breaks. The extension allows users to start a Pomodoro session, pause it, and customize the duration of the session.
